I'm rushing to security. Is everything okay? Yeah, we're fine. Just checking in. -Sorry. -Are you gonna make it? Yeah, I think med-checks should go quickly. I meant make it here before midnight. You're still in Singapore. Well, Hawaii is 18 hours behind. It's just over six hours to Tokyo. Another six to Honolulu. So, I'll be there with plenty of time to spare. New Year's Eve. One delay... Hey, hey. There won't be any delays. Hold on. Hey, sorry. I'm running late this morning. I just need to scan your badge, and we'll get you through quickly. BRODIE: Thank you. Now, tell your Aunt Carrie I'm expecting some homemade haggis, neeps, and tatties waiting for me, all right? -DANIELA: Okay. -I'll see you soon. Hey, Dad. I'm really glad that we're doing this. And I'm sorry that it's taken so long for us to be together. BRODIE Don't apologize. I know you have a busy life at school. Yeah, thanks to you. That's my job, sweetheart. I wouldn't have it any other way. Well, almost. (PLANE ENGINE ROARING) (PANTING) -MAN: Captain Torrance? -Yeah, sorry I'm late. It's fine, sir. The flight officer hasn't even come by yet. -BRODIE: Good. -Oh. Samuel Dele. -Nice to meet you. -Oh, nice to meet you. -Happy New Year. -(GRUNTS) And to you. -Where are you from? -Uh, Hong Kong, sir. Did my training at the Civil Aviation Department. Oh, yeah. I hear that's a great academy. And you, sir? English, I'm guessing? Hell, no. I wouldn't lower myself. -Nope. I'm Scottish. -(CHUCKLES) Oh. Although I did fly RAF Transport years ago. Back then, all the sexy assignments went to the English blokes. I didn't mind, though, because for me, the heavies were an easy path into the airlines. (IPAD BEEPING FAINTLY) Well, it looks like they're pushing us through weather. BRODIE: Of course they are. Gentlemen, let's see. One-hundred and nineteen, fourteen passengers. Everything cleared. Any questions? Yeah. Looks like we're pushing through some serious weather. It's converging here over the South China Sea. We're aware of it. By the time you get there, -it should have moved inland. -What if it sits there and stews? We can push out east, come north over Luzon? That adds an hour and 18K in fuel. The flight's nearly empty, so we need to shorten. Take it to 37. You'll clear that weather. Good flight. Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Do our iPads control the weather like his does? (LAUGHS) There you go. (GRUNTS, SNIFFS) Hello, gentlemen. My name's Bonnie. I'll be your chief tonight. -Oh. Nice to meet you, Bonnie. -Good to meet you. Um, Captain, you're needed in the Jetway. -Okay. -See you soon, Cap. Captain Torrance, Flight Commander. How can I help you? Fugitive extradition to Toronto. We'll be with you as far as Tokyo. He'll remain in constraints and be under my constant supervision. Well, is he dangerous? What did he do? Homicide. 15 years ago. Wasn't expecting that. MAN: We found him in Bali under an alias. And he's been around, I'll say that. Yeah, this is a bare flight. You're gonna attract a lot of attention. I don't wanna scare the rest of the passengers. I'm afraid you're stuck with us, Captain. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) All right. Just keep away from everyone else, please. Copy that. Let's go. (PLANE WHOOSHING IN THE DISTANCE) (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) -Did you check the back there? -Everything is set back there. Evening, ladies. -Evening, Captain. -Evening.

(LAUGHS) You think? -And where's home? -Daniela goes to college in California. And, uh, I'm based out of Singapore. The distance must be quite challenging for you and your wife, no?

BONNIE: Um, we have some cuts and bruises, but, um, I think everyone's just pretty rattled. BRODIE: Anyone have cell service? No. No one. DELE: What do we do about the prisoner? I don't know. That's a new one for me. Um... I saw him eyeing the officer's keys, so I took them. Is he dangerous? BRODIE SIGHS) He's being extradited on a murder charge. The officer... The officer said, yeah, he might be dangerous. Look, we just keep an eye on him and keep him separate from the other passengers, okay? Just try your best. -BONNIE: Okay. -All right. BONNIE: Here. I think you should hold on to these. (BIRDS CHIRPING) -BRODIE: Okay. Let's go. -Okay. BRODIE: Yeah, okay. WOMAN: Water... Just nowhere. -PASSENGER 3: What's going on? -PASSENGER 4: Tell us something.

I want to thank you all for your cooperation. I'm sorry for what we just had to go through, and I know you all have questions. -PASSENGER 4: Yeah. -Yeah. So, here's the situation. We got hit by lightning and our main power and comms are down. Okay, so, as of now, there's no way of calling for help. -PASSENGER 3: What? You're kidding. -No way? No way? What I need everybody to do right now, listen up... -MAN: How come? -...is remain calm. All right? Once the plane cools down, we're gonna get back on there, we're gonna get our things, get some water and we're gonna figure out what we're gonna do. Do you know where we are? BRODIE: Yeah, we think that we're near Davao in the southern Philippines. -You think? -BRODIE: We think. -PASSENGER 3: Very reassuring. -BRODIE: Rest assured, me and the crew are gonna do everything we can to make sure that we get you out of here safely. All right? Okay. Thank you. Okay, come on. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) -SCARSDALE: Hey, Terry. -TERRY: Hey. Everyone, this is David Scarsdale. He specializes in corporate strategy and crisis management. -Happy New Year. -SCARSDALE: Let's hope so. Is this the last point of contact? Yes, it is. SCARSDALE: That's a hell of a storm. What idiot sent them flying through that? It's airline protocol. Flight was light. It was the most efficient route. I thought they could fly above it. You thought? What, are you a fucking meteorologist, too? How much fuel did you save? About $12,000. Well, congratulations. That's barely tip money on this deal. The clock is ticking. Every minute matters. If that plane ditched at sea, or crash landed, we can count those minutes in lives lost or saved. Got it? Okay, so, what can I do? Call the military? US assets? What are your best options? Well, in that part of the world, there's only one option right now. What's that? You're gonna want the lawyers out of here. TERRY: It's fine. Tell me. Private assets. I'm already into it. -TERRY: Mercenaries? -Terry... The Philippines are not the Amalfi Coast. Now, I need a group working on press releases for every possible scenario. A ghosting like Malaysia 370. A crash landing with no survivors. A hijacking with demands. If you have plans for New Year's Eve, I just canceled them. BRODIE: A little further. Yeah, right to the end. -Tight as we can. -MAN: Yeah. Why can't we just stay inside the plane? -(BRODIE SIGHS) -It's safe and dry. Well, that's a good question, Mister, uh... Sinclair. Matt Sinclair. Well, without air conditioning, that plane is gonna cook in the sun. So, we're better off out here, with the shelter and a breeze. Hey, while you're there, you wanna step in, help secure that, Matt Sinclair? Okay, if you're in your bags, you find anything like, uh, bug spray, sunscreen, food, please share. All right? Mr. Gaspare. (SIGHS) Well... Looks like we've got ourselves in a bit of a mess here. (BOTH CHUCKLING) And so, I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do with you. To be honest, I'm a bit surprised you're still here. You think I'm fucking stupid enough to try and escape in a jungle I don't know? In handcuffs? Unless you're offering. I don't think I can do that. Then we have nothing to talk about. (BIRDS CHITTERING) BRODIE: Shit. (SIGHS) This is what happens when a 40-amp fuse gets hit with enough juice to light a city. Check it out, man. (BRODIE PANTING) DELE: What about the radio? (SIGHS) Let's see here. (SNIFFS) Oh, no. It's fried, melted. And the transponder? (GRUNTS) It's hard to tell without the power. (BRODIE GRUNTS WEARILY) If we could reroute the isolation bus to the essential bus, we could draw down more amps from the battery. In theory. (EXHALES) Captain, plane's fully unloaded except for the, uh, bodies and their personals. -I'll handle it. -BONNIE: Okay. -Hey, Bonnie. -Yeah? Sorry about Isabella. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (UNZIPS BAG) -What are you doing, man? -You know what they say. No video, didn't happen. Here we all are. Alone, in the jungle. No idea of how we're gonna get out. Survivors of the worst fucking plane ride in the history of bad plane rides. There's our lovely plane that decided to fall out of the sky. Trailblazer. Never flying this again. There's our snacks. They're gonna last us about an hour. DELE: Zero-sixteen. Carried that course for 13 minutes. So, assuming the transponder went down with the lightning strike... Let's do the math. That's 17 minutes, 300 miles per hour. So, multiplying that out, that's... Shit. That's over a thousand square miles' search radius. It'll take a miracle to find us here. Captain. This island here? Jolo? It's very, very bad. -What... -It's run by separatists and criminals. There's no government or police. If this is where we landed, we're not safe. All right, we tell Bonnie. But let's keep this to ourselves for now. MAN: And then there's this guy, Mr. Mysterious. Very friendly. -No, no, no. (GRUNTS) -BONNIE: Captain! Keep me out of your fucking videos! BONNIE: Hey, did you hit your head? Are you okay? Maria, can you please get the medic bag? MARIA: Yep. I'm gonna need you to do an on-camera hit for the press, Terry. We'll have a statement prepared, but you'll need to take questions, too. Shouldn't we wait till we know a little bit more? If we wait until we know more, it looks like you're hiding something. Just show your concern, be humble. -You know the drill. -Got it. Here you go. (SIGHS) You, Mr. Fuckin' Weatherman. Time to redeem yourself. I need everything on that aircraft. Flight times, maintenance logs. Names of the techs who last serviced the plane. -Everything. -Yes, sir. Got it. (BAG UNZIPPERING) (ANIMALS CHITTERING) (SIGHS) (BRODIE GRUNTING) (EXHALES) You sure about this, Captain? No. But we're running pretty low on options. Look, I'm not tying him up. If he runs, at least he's away from the others, right? All right. Let's go and break it to the others. (ZIPS BAG) (BIRDS CHIRPING) All right, everybody. Listen up. So, here's our situation. Mr. Dele and I, from our calculations, we believe that we have landed on an island somewhere in the Sulu cluster. We don't know which island. The problem is the area between where the transponder was struck by lightning to here is so vast that search and rescue could take some time. -Jesus Christ. -MAN: How long is it gonna take? We're also gonna have to ration food and water. What's your next move? Smoke signals? Can you just keep it to yourself? Cut him a break. At least he landed the plane. We didn't crash. We're in the middle of nowhere though. -We're stranded. -MATT: Yeah, come on, man. MAN: We didn't crash, man. BRODIE: Listen, last night, we flew over some kind of facility. I'm hoping they have a phone or a radio. If I can get there, make contact, we could be rescued in hours. Until then, I need everybody to be careful because we don't know what's going on in that jungle. -I'll go with you. -I will come, too. I appreciate it. But Mr. Gaspare has kindly volunteered to come. MATT: (SCOFFS) What? MAN: You're taking a guy in handcuffs? -(SCOFFS) -Makes sense. (HANDCUFFS CLINKING) (SIGHS) Come on. MAN: Datu! Datu! Datu! (SPEAKING TAGALOG) Well, we're doing everything we possibly can to find Flight 119, sparing no expense. REPORTER: Have you determined that the plane has crashed? Uh, no, that's not the assumption. -We have very little... -You sure it's Dad's flight? -We are coordinating... -CARRIE: I'm sure. TERRY: ...the search and rescue efforts in the region. No. TERRY: As soon as we have some updates, hopefully some positive news, we'll get right back to you. (BIRDS CHITTERING) I peeked through your officer's bag for supplies. I came across your pocketknife. You former military or something'? Groupe des Commandos Parachutistes. French Foreign Legion. Pay and benefits suck, but they don't ask any questions if you can hack it. Questions? Nothing's black and white, Captain. I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time. No one cares what really happened. I was 18 and fucked. So, rather than, uh, rot in prison, I ran, joined the Legion. End of story. BRODIE: How'd you get caught? Forget it. Doesn't matter. (EXHALES) Now let me ask you something. Did you bring my knife? Sorry, no. I left it in the bag. How about the dead officer's gun? BRODIE: We should be getting close about now.

That's gonna be extra, Scardy. That's going to be extra. Happy fuckin' New Year. Out. They're on their way. They'll reach the area in about three hours, then parachute in once we get the plane's location. JIM: So, how much in the emergency fund? Half million. Great.

She confirmed the details of the recording. And she said he told her they went down somewhere in the Jolo island cluster. I need Key Hole satellite access to this area to find that plane. Our assets are going airborne, and we'll circle the Jolo cluster until we get them a drop location. But I need you to call in some favors -and make it happen. -Got it.

Dave, found the plane. Jolo island. Torrance was right. Stand by. SCARSDALE: And there it is. TERRY: Can't believe it's intact. Sending the coordinates to our assets now. They'll drop on-site ASAP. Well, there's really no need. They'll contact the Philippine government. Surely, they'll send local authorities -with a search and rescue. -It won't be that easy, Terry. -TERRY: Why? -Because there is no authority on Jolo island. It's run by separatists and militias. The Filipino army won't even go there anymore. They got their asses kicked so many times. Look, the guys will parachute in. But they're gonna need some help getting everyone out. (ENGINE STOPS) BRODIE SIGHS) The village is two kilometers in that direction. You know you can't just ask for them back. Yeah, well, you're the military man. I was hoping you'd have some ideas.

(TERRY SIGHS) Filipinos won't send a rescue team without a battalion of troops in support. They're saying 24 hours. True to form. Any sign of the passengers or the rest of the crew? SHELLBACK: That's a negative, boss. At least from what I see right now. Shit. Trailblazer CP, you're seeing this, right? Looks like we may have a hostage situation on our hands. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING IN DISTANCE) GASPARE: You see the boats? They're fueling them up. (WHISPERING) Shit. Taking them off the island. Once they're gone, that's it.

SHELLBACK: We're Trailblazer's forward advance crew on this. John Isaac. Mo, Willis, and Lake. So, hold on. You're the advance crew. When is the rescue team getting here? SHELLBACK: Twenty-four hours is the best Trailblazer can do, so, unfortunately, we just became the rescue team. Twenty-four hours. We won't be left by then. I understand, and that's why we need to work up a contingency. Now, we did bring an emergency fund, but not enough to buy our way off this island. So... What do you suggest we do, Captain? (WHISPERING) Fuck. (SIGHS) I got a plan. No, that's not the assumption. We have very little information at present. However, we are coordinating with all the search and rescue efforts in the region. -Hopefully... -(TURNS TV OFF) Dad. I don't know if you'll get this, but... I love you so much.

If I didn't believe it could be done, I would not put you guys back on that plane. I have a daughter. I have every intention of hugging her again and making it home.

Shellback, how long have I got? Two minutes tops. Can't be certain the damage already done won't affect flight characteristics or that the engines won't fail. SCARSDALE: Shellback said it can be done. He's the man on the ground. Short of proper inspection, he's not qualified to make that determination. They're being hunted, Terry. And you're talking about inspections? After all they've been through, imagine the fallout if I allow Torrance to fly that plane and incinerate everybody in it. Imagine the fallout if you don't. Make sure they get on okay. Come on. -Run, run, run! -(GRUNTING) (PASSENGERS SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Everybody on. BONNIE: Come on. Let's go. Let's go, Maria. (GRUNTING) BRODIE: Ah, fuck.
