From humble beginningsto legendary award-winning journalist,Jaime Maussan has beentrusted as the voiceof the people in Mexicofor more than 47 years.For the first time the audience will haveaccess to the information of a UFO caseThat code we explain using thetechnology and knowledge we have on earthThis case was carefullystudied by our 60 minutes teamand it turns out to beamazing and fascinatingJoining us to talk about theUFO subject the specialistArturo Garza Rodriguezdirector of Alternative UFOGood morning thank youfor being in here with usMr. Joel Sampayo climate,sky reports and skeptic.Good morning thank youfor being in here with usUFO Specialist Jaime Maussan good morningIn the mid '90s, Maussanbrought the subjectof UFOs to the spotlight.- Then I became the anchorand finally the directorof this show that wason the air until 1995.From then on, I becameinvolved with somethingthat I thought was very important.UFOs.I know many people thinkthat they are not importantthat they are an illusion or fantasybut I realized thatmany people had camerasat the beginning of the '90sand they were able to record the UFOs.And I thought that I had a chancewith these evidences tochange the way people think.Maussan has receivedthe United Nations Global 500 Award,three times the NationalPrize of Journalism in Mexico,the Ondas Award for journalists in Spain.He was recognized at theCapitol in Washington, DC.Currently he is presenting"Third Millennium News"from Monday to Friday at 10:00p.m. on national television.This news has set thestandard for audience recordsfor the channel a+ on several occasions."Tercer Milenio" continues to be presentedevery Sunday on prime time after 22 yearsof uninterruptedtransmission on Mexican TV.- I was not gonna be a journalist.I was gonna be an administrativeworker for my father.He had a company and he wishedthat I was able to takecare of his company.And I never thought that Iwanted to be a journalist.Because 50 years ago,the journalist in Mexicowere not very honest.They wanted money for everything they puton the TV or in a newspaper.And my father was arancher, he had bull fights.He was also impresario for big bull rings.He organized bull fights.Even my aunt was a bull fighter.Then I was going to become one.But at the same time,my father wanted me totake care of his business.But in the last day whenI had to choose my major,a friend of mine came to me and asked mewhat was going to be my future,what kind of major I was going to choose,business administrationsomething like that.And he said, "Oh, that's boring."And I said, "Why?"Because it's just numbers,it's just in a closedplace with no windows.And I said, "What are you going to study?"He said journalism.And I said, "Oh, you'regoing to be a corrupt man.You're gonna try totake money from people."And he said, "No, journalismis to change the world.Journalism is the possibilityto create conscious.Journalism is traveling.Journalism is going into the openand reporting what you find."And I liked that.And I immediately changed my major,probably the best decisionI have done in my life.Then I decided, but myfather didn't like the idea.And at the same time,he knew that the journalistsin Mexico were corrupt.And I said to my father,"I will never ever, Father,take any money from anyone.I'm gonna be a very cleanand honest journalist."And I have kept that promise until now.I've been an honest man all my life.And thanks to that,I've been able to develop credibility.When I was a young kid, Isaw the destruction of naturebut I didn't know why I didn't like it.I knew that the animals were being killed,that there was a businessdoing with animals,that anybody could take an animalfrom their habitats and sell it.When I found journalism,when I found my real passion for life,I really started totry to change my world.And I was able to do it in many waysbecause I worked intelevision with the mostimportant journalist inMexico, Jacobo Zabludovsky,the Walter Cronkite of the US,a man that was very wellknown everywhere in Mexico.And I became very close to him,in many ways his right hand,even though I was a teenager.When I did my first report,I took my report to Cannes in France.I was just 19.And I received a scholarship from the USfrom an American university,University of Ohio.And I was able to finish my career there.When I came back, I startedworking in journalismto try to protect the environment,to try to protect thewoods and the jungles.I was able to find the Monarchbutterfly in Mexico there,the hidden places where they hibernate.Fred Urquhart, a Canadian scientist,he's the one who found it, I mean,he's the one who reallytracked the Monarch butterfly.But he published his articlein National Geographic.He never said what it was.My network Televisa askedme to go and find the place.It took us two years tofind it, but we finally did.And I was able to presentfor the first timeto the Mexican peoplethe Monarch butterflyand I was able to get protectionfor the Monarch butterfly.Then working in "60 Minutes"in Mexico as reporter,I was able to get involvedwith the protection of the turtles.In Mexico, we used to kill theturtles in slaughterhouses.And thanks to my report in "60Minutes," they were closed.We created laws to protect the turtles.And that's the reason why someof these species of turtleshave now recuperated.I was able to do many things to speakabout the climate change or theglobal warming back to 1986.I was able to speakabout the El Nino currentin '87 or the depletionof the solar layer in '88.We were just two journalistsfrom all around the world who wentwith NASA to the North Pole to reportif there was a hole in the North Pole,as the one that had beenobserved in the South Pole.They found that no, there was not a hole.It was a little bit depletedbut we didn't have the same problem.Because of the currents aredifferent in both poles.Anyway, I was able to bethere with a German journalistand even the NASA people were amazedthat they said a reporter,a journalist from atropical country is here.Why the Americans, why theEuropeans are not here?But I was very much involvedin the protection of environment.And when I found that news,the Televisa allowed meto go and participatewith NASA in these investigationsback in January, 1988.And I was able to domany other things like,for example, to help the Tarahumarasin the Sierra in Mexico.They were dying of hunger and cold.And also in '88, '87, wewere able to get thousandsof tons of food for them with that reportin "60 Minutes" in Mexico.Then I became the anchorand finally the directorof this show that wason the air until 1995.From then on, I becameinvolved with somethingthat I thought was very important.UFOs.I know many people thinkthat they are not important,that they are an illusion or fantasy,but I realized thatmany people had camerasat the beginning of the '90sand they were able to record the UFOs.And I thought that I had achance with these evidencesto change the way people think.Back in '90, '91, there was atotal solar eclipse in Mexico,probably the longest or the second longestin the whole century, sixminutes and 54 seconds.And people, many people inMexico recorded the solar eclipsebut some people got UFOs inthe middle of their videos.And I thought that was very important.Hours later during theastronomical phenomenonon TV program 24 Hourswith Jacobo ZabkudevskyGuillermo Arreguin's videoshowed a flying saucerwhich was silver color on thetop side and dark underneathit seemed to be spinning andflew for several minutes over MexicoDays later, more videos appearedand this was the beginning of themost important UFO surge of the90s and that it remains till this dayBut this also reignited Mexicanculture of watching the skyObviously other voices cried outthat this was a misinterpretationimages or that it was the planetVenus, However up until 2009those voices have notpresented any analysis or researchto end the controversyWhat is clear for us is thatthis unidentified flying objectwas seen in different places ofcentral Mexico which implies that thiswasn't something imagined. Since thesame object appears in most of the videosThis video was seen around theworld and has been presented in differentTV programs. This solar eclipse begana new era of study and research of UFOsphenomenon in our country becausecitizens had in their hands the necessarytechnology to record those strange ufoswhich they could only talk about beforeor say, "I saw one". So, they know nowhow important video cameras are- I was invited to this programbecause I had done a reporton "60 Minutes" about BillyMeier and people identified me.But as a matter of fact,I didn't want to go tothis television showbecause I thought that UFOswere not good for journalists,that they were very riskyand I shouldn't get involved with this.But my company, my network asked me to goto the show, "Y usted que opina?"And it was so successfulthat they asked me to gofor a second time and I didn't want to go.I really didn't want to go.I said, "That's it, no more UFOs please."But this man insisted,"Please, this is the last time.Let's do another showbecause you know howmany people saw these,millions and millionsand millions of people.And I want to do a new one."And I say, "Okay, butthis is the last one.This is really the last show."And I went there and I wasable to find these videosthat were recorded by some peopleof the eclipse where they found UFOs.When I presented this,very early in the morning,probably three or fouro'clock in the morning,it was a revolution.Thousands of peoplecame to the television.At five o'clock in the morning,there were more than five or 10,000 peopleoutside the station becausethey wanted to get inbecause they were soexcited with these videos.And after that show, nothingwas the same for me in my life.I received many invitationsfrom different universities in Mexico.Then I received invitationsfrom international congressesaround the world and I couldn't get away.I couldn't get away anymore.Then I started without even thinkingto get so much involvedbecause people send me videosand hundreds of videos of UFOs.And then I realized thatthis was very important.This was a new phenomenon,a phenomenon inside the phenomenon,where people were recordingthese things with camerasbecause everybody had a camera nowor many people had acamera, VHS back in 1991.And I thought with thedevelopment of technology,more and more and more peopleare gonna have cameras.And then I said, well, Iam very sure in the futureeveryone is gonna have a cameraand we be able to have many more videos,many more evidences.And I started to promotepeople to watch the sky,when they have time to watch the skyand record whatever it was there.I never thought thiswas gonna be successfulbut then I received onevideo recorded by one person,and then another and another and anotherand then dozens and then hundreds.And then I didn't know what to dowith so much evidence I had.In 1995 ended "60 Minutes"and I received moreand more invitationsto present conferences.And I went all around Mexico,and I mean all around Mexico,presenting all the evidenceswith full theaters.And I'm talking thousandpeople, 2,000 people everywhere.And I couldn't escape anymore.I became the center ofthis phenomenon in Mexico.In 1997, I started the show,"Tercer Milenio" on Televisa.That lasted until 2003.Then when out of the air.- Televisa had a huge network,the national network inMexico, asked me to come backand present "Tercer Milenio" in 2004.We are in the midstof a reality that changesIt evolvesIt's closer to us everydayClear messages that appearin the farmlands of Englandthat can't be consideredthe pranks of a few hoaxersOur job has been tobring this information to youto get you closerThis is the age of encounterWe must realize that welive in extraordinary timesAnd I did itand I have been on theair since 2004 until now.A very successful show.Now it's running in a different network,also a national network,Azteca, and we have even growin numbers in ratings for around2 million people watchthe show every week,which probably shouldbe considered the mostsuccessful show on UFOs around the world.- UFOs have been the stuffof conspiracy theoristfor decades often mockedfor talking about it.But maybe they shouldn't be mocked.Commander David Fravor spent 18 yearsas a Naval aviator pilot.In 2004, he had an unforgettableencounter with an aircrafthe said was defying the laws of physics.Commander Fravor joins us tonight.Thanks for coming on tonight.Tell us what you saw.- Well, we had launched ona routine training mission.When we joined up, we were toldthat the event was gonna be canceledand then we have real-world taskingand we were sent out to the west.Now take in mind that this has taken placeabout a hundred milessouthwest of San Diego,between San Diego and Ensenada, Mexicoon a clear perfect day, blue waters.We get out to the spotwhere they tell us it's at,we start looking around and both of us,both airplanes see adisturbance in the waterand a white 40 foot longTic Tac shaped objectjust hovering above thewater going forward,back, left to right.There's no rotor wash.There's no wings, nothing.So as we drive around in a clockwise flow,we get to about the nine o'clock position,and I said I'm gonna godown and check it outand the other jet is gonna stay high.So as we go down, when we getto the 12 o'clock position,it starts to mirror us.So it's in a clockwise flow and it'son the opposite sideof the circle from us.And we continue, it's ina climb or in a descent,we're getting a great look at it.This whole thing takes about probably upto five minutes from the time we show up.I get over to the eight o'clock position.It's at about the two o'clock positionand I decide I'm gonnago and see what it isand it's about 2,000 feet below me.And I cut across thecircle and as I get withinabout a half mile of it,it rapidly acceleratesto the south in about twoseconds and disappears.At one moment you weresurrounded by these objectsAccording to the informationI heard from the back cabinfrom the chief operational coordinatorthere came a moment that he sawon the screens that theobjects were in the backon the left side and in front ofus. It was at that moment whenI felt a little tension- What would you estimate the speed?- At well above supersonic.Like a bullet out of a gun, it took off.- So from what you knowabout aerodynamics,mechanics, physics, shouldthis be possible, what you saw?- Not with the technologythat we have today.Not at all.- Even now, even 13 years later,is there anything that you know of capableof this kind of you have behavior?- No, there is nothing I know of.When we saw the video with the IRR,it has no exhaust it,no discernible thingsof anything form of propulsion,and this thing came from a dead hoverover the water just kind of moving aroundto a climb up to about 12,000 feetto rapidly accelerating away in a climband in less than two seconds, it was gone.And you figure, you'retalking 50 miles of visibilityand you can easily see an objectthat size easily out to 10 milesand it just disappeared in seconds.But in spite of that theynever could see them?We could never identify themvisually with the naked eyeSo it was only possible to detectthe presence of them through FLIR?Yes only with the infraredFLIR system, preciselyThat is, they wereinvisible to the eye?I think so because none ofthe crew members could see itwith the naked eyeFrom that distance, shouldyou have been able to see them?The closest we were wastwo miles which a normal objector aircraft, experience tellsme that we should have been able toThat's the question we areleft with from that operation- What would be theeffects on a human pilotof the G-forces involvedin that altitude change?- Well, the altitude wouldn't be bad.It would be theacceleration of the object.Well, honestly, I wanted to fly it.- Yeah, I bet.- Talking to some physicists,they don't think thehuman body could handlethat kind of force with that acceleration.- It doesn't sound likethe human body could.So bottom line, whatdo you think this was?- I believe, as do the other folksthat were on the flightwhen we visually saw it,that it was something not from this world.- Presumably, you expressedthat belief to your superiors.What did they say?- Actually, we caught alot of grief getting backto the boat and it gotpassed off as an eventthat no one could explain.Now, keep in mind, theyhad been tracking thesefor two weeks prior to us seeing it.And this was the firsttime that manned airplaneshad been airborne whenthe objects appeared.- This feels like areally big story to me.It's not exactly clearwhy Vladimir Putin'smore interesting than this.I think this seems like a big deal.And Commander, I appreciateyour taking the timeto talk to us about it.- Back in 2004, the Secretary of Defensein Mexico called me todeliver a video to me.They recorded this videoon March the fifth, 2004,close to the Campeche areabut the plane was in themiddle of the jungle.They were able to record these lightsfollowing the airplane.11 lights following the airplane.The Mexican scientists wentto the television to saythat they were, how you say,lightning or energy in there.Bolt lighting, 11 bolt lighting followingand surrounding an airplane.They went to theSecretary of Defense laterand said, "Oh, we are sorry.Oh, we were wrong, sorry.But they would never say that publicly.You see?But they know they were wrongbecause the Secretary ofDefense wouldn't deliver a videoof UFOs if he knew it was something else.Then I can tell you thatproves that in Mexicoeven the authorities areready to accept this.The only reason we don't do it is becausewe don't want to confront the US.We don't want to confrontthe scientists from the USbecause they would make funof the Mexican governmentand they would make jokes about that.Nobody's ready for that.More information on the targetIt's traveling at speed 206and it's on a 3.01 courseHere it goes, here it goes,there it goes, there it goesAnd why are you picking it up until now?What is it, Juarez? Juarez, what is it?It is a pointA pointThere it isIt's directly behind usCorrect, now it's at 7 o'clockposition with 10.5 milesIt's on course 2.83 and 3.34 speed.Well, I am about to lose it on theradar and it's about to leaveAt 7 o'clock at the same altitudeThere are some clouds. It should be thereWhat are we seeing here... Thereare some important apsectsto comment on in addition tothe audio of the 501 squad crewYou can see two verylarge lights and below thema point that is not as brightbut that is where the X isindicating maximum heatthat is, the biggest energy pointof those lights precisely belowLet's see, what we have here?Nothing SirYesCommander, what is that?What was the distance more or less, Tellez?Hey, get ready... it's like...There are more. More are following behindThere are 10 or 11 objectsAnother important aspect is that we seethe objects are movingfor those who suggested that these were,in fact, oil wells, the oil well burnersBut we can clearly see,with the clouds for reference.It remains more or less stable andthe objects are moving while the cloudsappear to be still. Another very importantaspect. I want you to see the numbers thatare on the left of your screen,there you will see a zero.Inside the zero is a small arrow.That arrow is indicating the inclinationof the FLIR cameraThere they go, there they goThree, four, five, six...There are six of them...That is to say that it is literallyat the horizon. It is not focusedtoward the ground, it is literally facingtoward the horizon and the aircraft wasflying at 3,500 metersAnd they're moving at speed but...one, two, three, four, five, six, seveneight on the screenFollow them, do not lose themDon't scare meLook out the window.We have one at approximatelyOne O'clock and the others remain at nineThey have you surrounded?Well, I don't knowHow far?It only tells meToday is your lucky day, young menWe are not aloneThey are surrounding usOne at 1 o'clockAt one, I have it 14.8 mileswith course 99 and speed of 52He is following one and Iam following the other oneOkay, one is on the radar, on FLIRWe are seeing it on FLIRIt is a luminous object,it is in the opposite direction of usbut it does not leave us,it is two miles behind us- I received a call from the secretaryof the Secretary of Defense in Mexico.She asked me to come.I had an appointment, I went there,I sit down in an office, nobody was there.And when I realized Iwas in the drug trafficfrom the administration from the military,and I said, "Jesus Christ, what happened?Did somebody say that I did something?What I'm doing here?I have to go, I have to go.This is the good."And then they came and say,"Mr. Maussan, can youcome with us please?"And I said, "Jesus Christ,what is gonna happen now?"And they took me to a little theaterand they put the videoon and they all said,"Can you explain this please?"And I saw it and I said,"Jesus, are these thingsfollowing the airplane?""Yes, and they surrounded the airplane."Yes."Can I talk to the pilots?""No, first tell us what you think."And I say, "Well, I think they are UFOs."The video had been recordedwith a FLIR camera.This camera was, in 2004,just for the military.It was a very specialized camerathat could track the infraredand could track the heat in the airspace.They were using thiscamera in this airplanebecause they were looking for narcoticsfrom drugs from South America.And they were in the areawhere is the shortestin Mexico from coast to coast.And the airplanes had to go through there.And it was fairly easy totrack these drug dealers.And they use this special equipment.And the military saw these lights.They couldn't see thelights with their eyes.They just saw it with the camera.But they knew, they hada screen in the airplaneand they were looking at the screeneven though they couldn'tfind it in the air,in the in the atmosphere,it was on the camera.And they got very nervous, especially whenthey were surrounded by these lights.The captain turned offthe navigation lightsbecause he thought he was gonnabe confronted by these UFOs.Then some people came and tried to explainthat video saying that they were oil rigs.Letting off fire-- Exactly and some other things, missilesand so many really crazy things.But the military were there every dayfor many hours in the same placeand they never saw something like this.And they couldn't explain it.When I told them that these were UFOs,they said, "Okay, thank youvery much, Mr. Maussan."And I left.They didn't tell me anything else.I receive a call againa couple of days laterand they say, "TheSecretary of Defense wantto see you personally in his office."I went there and then he asked me,"What do you think they are?"And I said, "UFOs, canI talk to the crew?""You will, you will.You are gonna be the onlyone who's gonna do that.I'm going to give you the tape.You can do whatever you want.Just remember that you havethe honor and the prideof the Armed Forces ofMexico in your hearts.Be very careful."When we made a turn to go towardsCampeche the FLIR camera operatordetected a whitea target without form. It wasshining. It was detected by theinfrared camera...and it was beingobserved at all times with that cameraLater we saw that we...We saw other targets on the left sideof the aircraft, Apparently, there wereeleven targetsIn this case, we can assume thatthese eleven pointsthat produced heat and that are seenthrough the FLIR videowere they thereeven though they were not visible?They were there, and wereferenced that by their positionsThey were always to the left of us, flyingat the same height, and at approximatelythe same speed. Well, we tried to findan image and the points remainedhot at all times, completely hotVery hot?Very hot. They did have an irregular shapeThey were always circlesIs this irregularwith respect to aircraft?That you have previously detected?Yes, it is irregular becausethey did not have a shapethey did not have a shape of any objectI have seen beforeIn other words, you have never seemor experienced this before?It had never happened to me,it is something thatI don't know what to say, I can'ttell you what it wasI couldn't relate this experience tosomething I saw before- "If somebody asks youwho gave you this video?"I thought, "Oh, he's gonna to say,'You don't know who gave you this.'""You are gonna say thatthe Secretary of Defensegave you these video."And I say, "Jesus Christ."My pants almost fell down.I had this evidence, theyhave given me this evidenceand the Secretary of Defenseof Mexico was supporting mewhatever I did with this.I felt a big responsibility.I investigated everythingI could with this tape.I had a chance to interview all the crew,the captain, and the cameraman,and everyone that was inside the planeand all of them told me, "This is real,we've never seen anything like this."And then I presentedthis video in a nationaltelevision program inMexico, in the newscast,in the most important newscaston may, the ninth, 2004.Next day, I gave a press conference andall the international mediacame to the press conference.I gave them this video andnext night or that nightit was everywhere around theworld in every single newscast.I don't think there is a sighting of UFOsthat has been presented everywherelike this happened in 2004.And then I thought that I haddone my job the best I could.I never expected that the explanationsthat were gonna begiven to this incrediblevideo were gonna be sostupid as they were.Simultaneously recording videoin the normal visual spectrumand infrared spectrum.This is the official name of the systemdeveloped by Pedro Avila,a Mexican that watches skyHe's the creator of thetechnique that some sayis a tool to study the UFO phenomenonworldwideWell, first of all,it makes me very proud to know that whatI'm presenting here is something real.It's something genuinePedro Avila, national directorof the sky watcherswho from this window recorded themost amazing unidentified flying objectsis the creator of the techniquewhich the official name of this system isSimultaneous video-recording techniquein the normal and infrared spectrum- After I learned that there were UFOsthat were invisible to the eye,I proposed that idea on television.And Pedro Avila, a UFOhunter who cannot walk,he's in a chair, he's looking throughhis window all day long, builta device to put two cameras,one infrared and one normal spectrum,and he was able, it's the only time thatthis has ever been done everywhere,where you have a camerarecording in the normal spectrumand the other camera in the infrared.And you can see thisobject in the infraredand you cannot clearly see anythingin the normal spectrumproving that there are UFOsthat are not visible tothe eyes, to the sight.And I think that was very important.From then on, more and more peopleand with the development of technology,even the FLIR technology nowavailable to many people,to almost anyone who wantsto have a FLIR camera now,you can have it, and nowmany people are recordingthese invisible UFOs everywhereand it is just amazing.And we are proving now thatwhat was said 15 years agowith the military in Mexico,it's happening in many,many places right now.You've got it froma few different locationswhere they filmed this,is that right, Darcy,that's in the documentary itself?Yeah, actually thetwo videos that were usedin the documentary thatwere pretty popularon TV network circulation back in the '90swhen this first happenedwere from the vantage pointof Puebla, which is justnorth of Mexico City,it's another little city, and Mexico City.So another famous UFO sightingwas the Jerusalem Temple Rock,a UFO that kind of hoveredaround the dome there.And that was recorded by, I think,five different individualswalking around the city.Are there specific hotspots wherethese craft are being seen continually?It comes from time to time.Right now, for example,from the last few years,couple three or four years,we've been receiving many videosfrom the northwest of Mexicoaround Rosarito, Tijuana,San Diego in California,even around Los Angeles.Around five, 10 years ago,there were hundreds of videosthat were coming from Russia.Probably Russia isbecause of the developmentof new nuclear weaponsbecause they happen mostlyaround St. Petersburg inthe Crimean Peninsula.They all just are mostly in placeswhere they have some interest.Now you said that there'sanother really massive siting something-- Oh yeah, yeah,let me tell you about it.The people might not be aware of.- The second interviewand I'm waiting to dothat third interview.On the morning, fouro'clock in the morningof December 19th, there was a huge,and I mean a huge UFOpyramid above the Pentagon?Some people say, "Oh, it's animation."No.I was able to find, Ithink I am the only onewho has investigated this case,the pyramids was just300 feet from the groundand in the middle of thePentagon, above the Pentagon.The images are incredible.Three different people,one of them that was walking with his dog.Another two people whowere in a taxi, in a cab.And the third one was taking photographsinside the cemetery in Arlington.The three of them withcameras in their hands,because they couldn'tdo it with a cell phone,were able to get incredible imagesof these pyramid moving androtating above the Pentagon.What is amazing is thatnormally in the US,not a single media, notThe Washington Post,The New York Times, CBS,NBC, et cetera, et cetera.What's that?This is aliens, I tell you.Yes, yes, I'm reallysorry but I was talking.Oh man, what is this?This is a fucking alien invasion.Do you see it?Where is it?Give me the camera.What is this?I mean, what the fuck is that?Turn left, left!Have we lost it?Look back, look back!I got you, baby.I see it.Turn right,turn right, turn right!Do you see it?Can it be like a ancient God?You're stupid.Slow down, man, slow down.What?It's gone.I don't, I don't see it.Man, do you see it?I've heard something on the news.Something about Russian military.No, it's not Russia.It's Pentagon.I seen it already, man.It's a bomber, itwas announced the news.You know.No, man.Turn on the radio,it should tell us something.Turn on the radio.Has done anythingaround this incredible case.We found something verysimilar that happenedon December the ninth,2010 above the Kremlin.In the Red Square in Moscow,exactly the same object.This was recorded and presented by RT.- The Kremlin has been circled by a UFO.Well, that's if you believea video which has soaredto the top of YouTube's Russian website.The pictures apparentlyshot from a passingcar have become an online sensation.Another YouTube clip filmed duringdaylight shows a fuzzy gray objecton the skyline near Red Square.Skeptics, however, say thatif the images were realthe public would havereported sightings to policewho are currently making no comment.And in differentmedia newscasts in Russia,it was never presented in the US.And it's exactly the same thing.And I believe that sightinghas a lot of meaning.I now know why it was there that day.That day Donald Trumpsigned the memorandumcreating the space combat command,the US Space CombatCommand that very same day.Amicizia - friendship wasan experiment carried outby beings from anotherworld to try to establishcommunication with humansto help our developmentThis is verydifficult to understand this.- Not really so.I believe it is in themoment you accept the ideathat the people for otherstars may live here.Then all comes immediately,it's quite easy to accept it.According to Stefano BrecciaNot only was a group established on Eartha group that they called w56but there were otherswho were given the nameof opposites or the CTR whohad other interests and valuesthis situation generated aconflict between both groupsthat even caused the death of some involvedthey explained to BrunoSamacicia and Giancarlo De Carlothat this group of aliensare on our planet becausethey are very concernedabout the destructive attitudethat man on Earth has toward natureThese beings explain thatthey are very concernedabout the atomic bombthat a nuclear weapon,in the event of a warcould destroy all ofhumanity in a few minutesThen they explained thatthey are here to take care of our planetand possibly humanityAccording to the witnesses andthe account of Stefano Brecciain his book mass contact, all those beingswho participated in amiciciawere moved by the deep moralityand sincere humanism of these beingsunable to imagin even doingharm to any person or animalhowever they liked to eat well,drink and even smoke sometimesThey liked to play tennis and playmusical instruments such as the violinit was their decision tokeep this story a secreteven though on some occasionsnews about their activity came outthe news was vague and uncertainAccording to Stefano Brecciathere were many who suspectedthat something was happening butno one outside the group couldimagine how great and deepthe contact withextraterrestrial beings wasOne of the participants whoprefers to remain anonymousconfessed to the researcher Nicola Duperthat in 2008 there were 200 beingsfrom the group that was called w56The w because it meantlife and the 56 for the yearin which the contact was madea disk is not generally used fortravel but as a mobile

poorEarthlings who struggle tounderstand the simplest of thingswithout complete successin most cases, another butvery important curiosity, isthat a spacecraft of this typeBut also all the others, evenlarge ones, are built with ironwhat we ofter call synthesizedin fact, a small ship likethe one in the photo aboveweighs around 15 to 20 tons of ironThe iron that w56 uses isno different from what we useexcept in a qualityinaccessible to us for nowThis iron is of the polarizedtype, therefore it is capable ofof offering qualities that no amorphousiron can possessamorphous, is an electricabnormality on the atomic levelthe amorphous solid, isa solid that has no formof its own and lackscrystaline lattice structurewith a long-range orderof positioned atomssolids in which there is a long-rangeatomic order called crystalline solidscrystalline material metals are difficultto prepare in an amorphous conditionthe solidification processgenerally has to be done very quicklyunless the material has a highmelting temperature like ceramicor a low level of crystallizationwhat usually happenswith polymers, in the iron from w56it has crystaline lattice structurethis type of iron is not a thermalconductor, nor an electric conductorit is non-magnetic and radiation resistantBut it can be madetransparent by applying anelectromagnetic fieldat a certain power levelthis peculiarity in factexplains why flying saucersare sometimes invisible during sightingsThere is more, the transparentsurface can be unilateralthat is only from theinside out or bilateralthat is from the outside inand vice versa and in that caseyou can see a disk like thisRegarding the bases of thesebeings, according to Stefano Brecciait was widely said that the aliens of w56had built a huge, very deepand practical underground baselocated at the bottomof the continental massand many more typicallysmall ones at shallow depthsthe large base was a point ofreference for all their European activitiesand normally it washousing machinerythe smaller bases wereused as places for livingthey said that they had otherbases withing our solar systembut they were not stable structuresActually generating or destroyinga base was a very simple process for themlet's think of two linear magnetsinitially parallel to eachotherrotating one of them around itscenter of gravity the lines of forcewill become more andmore intertwined as the anglebetween the magnetsincreases after a critical attractionthe lines of force of the magnetic fieldwill change abruptly, arranging themselvesin a new arrangement thatprevents them from twisting too muchOur friends, on the other hand, were ableto generate what they called a magnetic ropethat is, a structure wherethe lines of force werestricly twisted around each otherSuch effect had the abilityof opening the matter,compressing it sideways,crushing it on itselftranslucent walls were almostcrystalline with an astronomical densityan equally high modulus of longitudinalelasticity and an incredible forcewere thus able to open the cavitiesthat would become their basesobviously without damagingin any way the tectonicstructures that surroundedit, on the contraryprobably by strengthening them,said structure remained stable as longas the fields that generated it were activeit was enough to turn offthese fields with click of a buttonto immediately return thematter back to it's original formsimilarly they were opening passages toaccess their bases when they needed themclosing them immediately when they were nolonger in use, rarely with very small basesJust below the ground stable corridors wereused in the large bases where also largeships generally in orbit around oursun aligned with respect to the eclipticat first it seems that therewere three different racesthe redheads, the copper-hairedpeople, the black-haired peoplemore similar to our indians today,the third race had greenish-white hairby the way their skin wascolored similar to their hairthese three races have evolved togetherwith the passage of time they beganto reproduce between eachotherso that a new race was bornbefore dying Bruno Sammaciccia toldus some of the most important messageshe had received from the beings called w56the first words they said were"this land was made forgood but the men who inhabit it""are transforming everything into evil""we are not here to conquer,we have nothing to overcome""our interests arise from the fact that""your land is within our stars"Gaspare De Lama participatedin the amicizia projectbetween 1960 and 1965, Ikept secret some of the evidencethat proves that the case really happenedas the witnesses have assuredGaspare, because of his closenessto Bruno Samaciccia, the leader of thegroup of humans in Italy,received photographs andmade some of the films that still existHere I am as a young man,41 years of age, here is BrunoSammaciccia? Sammacicciain the little green gardenof the village Montesilvanohe always told me, "Don't betrayyour memories" It is written in the photoGaspare agreed to showsome of the 8mm photographsand films that he stillhas in his possessiondo you see this black part here? we calledthis "Penachito" this is a small modelof about 4 meters this is modelit was remotely controlledit does not require a crew memberIt had a small detector thatwe called "the little mouse"in additon to the video, we also tookpictures of this craft, it was a kind of...now I speak in an incorrect non-scientificway, it was a kind of energy that condensesI saw that it was on the surface, Idon't know what kind of energy it wasIt is in an irregular way, here yousee it and here it does not come offin these photos the energy appearsand dissappears, in the same diskthis disk followed us until wegot close to Milan in these photoswe are taking this photo from an open fieldwe had an appointment with this diskby the w56 to recordit with photos and filmThis disk here, it was a giftfrom them to me, they said"you will see the technology we have"They lived most of their time intheir huge underground bases butsome of them lived amongus within our society playingall kinds of roles in the worldOne was a university researcher,another the managing director of a fairlyimportant textile companyin the center of Italya third was a senior manager at one ofthe largest German telecommunicationscompanies names T.L.CBut the most important difference betweenall the contact stories that can be readis the role that we Earthlings play inthe eyes of our counterparts from off worldthis was expressed many times thatwe inhabitants of this distressed planetenjoy unique psychic abilitieswhile we are unaware of itthe w56 said this ability was oneof the main reasons they came here"often it was even fun for us towatch these people with such""fantastic technology by their side""begging our help in particularoperations against their enemies"and when the story came to an abrupt endit was because of a failure on our partwhen most of the earthlings gotscared or simply fooled by the enemythen we stopped supporting the w56friends, this development was enoughto endanger them by reducingtheir superiority against their enemiesthey had to stop their operationshere and retreat to their originshowever they promisedto return in the futurein a surprising way, Emelioappeared at an event wherePiere Giorgio Caria andJaime Maussan would presentevidence of their researchand agreed after having repeatedlyrefused to discuss the amicizia caseThe amicizia case is true,there are people who havetraveled from another worldit is not true that they left in 1978because a small group is still herethe basis of this story is truebut not very pleasant thingshave happened in thesense of human relationshipshumans know themselves, it is notdefined by materialism and spiritualityGaspare was the only one left in the groupI decided to stay, because I felt this waythe amicizia case, itis truely extraordinarythings have happened and they are true.Have you learned the wayof my friend's teachings?There are three types ofwritings, one of the blue peopleanother of the giantsand another of the dwarfsit is something similar to an alphabetwhich I have been able to learnbecause I have an unusual sensitivitythis is how I was ableto read their writingsdo you understand them completelyor is this how you interpret them?That's right, Bruno replied tome a lot because he has seenme speak to them in their own languagethey haven't spoken to many othersBruno told me one thing within theframework of lawsof his federation, what we could callcosmic laws, something that they lived byotherwise we would be worseoff, but we agreed that they would notintervene with our historyThere are laws where if you wantsomething sooner or later, this is achievedwithout interventionbut I think, and I feel that they canintervene, I don't know in what way thoughvery light intervention andwithin thelimits in which they can be acceptedthey need the presence of asignificant number of the populationlike when a teacherarrives who was summonedand a god or supreme beinggives the people what they needI think a significant mass is requiredthey will then act at thelimit of their interventionwithout intervening with our freedomas when you are a child and they tell youthat you should nottouch that electrical outletbut the second time,the child know that heshould not touch it for his own goodI remember that on theday that I was with Jaime Maussanand Joseph Garofalo, they werevery important collaborators of mineGarofalo was a verycapable computer analystwith which we analyzed thephotographs and videos of amiciziaand we were going withJaime and Garofalo to the citywhere the house of theVirgin Mary is locatedthe city of Loretto thatwas transpired theretells the story by the angelsand while we were on the roadon the highway Garofalo watchedhe saw that we were followedby a saucer and unfortunatelyhe was able to record video at themoment when the saucer was already veryfar away, but by analyzing this videothe object is very similarto the amicizia objectsgreet us? we do not know but it is anotherinteresting fact that we can add to thisincredible story, maybeanother will come outbut not until todayat least as I already saidabout another protagonistwho is Emilio, he didnot accept to go out tothe public and gave us aninterview, he is also very old butperhaps in the futureother material will come out- They know, the security agencies knowthat sooner or later one ofthese cases is gonna go out.It's gonna be on YouTubeand it's gonna be recordedby different people at the same time.Just consider for one second.If the Zimbabwe incidentin September, 1994if this happens now with all the kidswith a cell phone, with a camera.Can you imagine five, 10kids recording the sameextraterrestrialspresenting them the same dayin the afternoon on YouTubeall around the world?How could you describe this?The agencies are ready to give up.You have to remember John Podesta talkingwhere he said he wrote in a tweet,the only thing that I regret workingfor Obama is that I couldnot open the ET phenomenon.And he became the manager, the chiefof the campaign of Hillary Clinton.And she said, "I'm going to open this."And I was rooting for herbecause I knew she was gonna do it.I know the Pentagon, I knowthe military were readybecause they cannot keepthese secrets so much longer.One of these days it's gonnacome up, it's gonna blow.The Chinese now have anincredible radio telescopefor one kilometer indiameter, something like that.And they are looking forsignals and they are lookingand everyone, everyone islooking for life there.Europeans, the Indians, everyone.This is changing so fast.You are gonna have the big telescopeslike ALMA in Chile or othertelescopes are gonna lookto the infrastructureof different planets.They're gonna look for cities.They're gonna look forsatellites around the planets.The James Webb telescope that is gonna beon orbit on 2020 or '21 isgonna look for infrastructure.There is not much time for the agencies.They have to open.The first try was on December 16th, 2017when The New York Timespresented this informationand Luis Elizondo from thePentagon came up and said,"I'm resigning there becauseI want this to be open"and they presentedthree incredible videos.And nobody has beenable to discredit that.Nobody.Then what happens?We have the evidence right there.It's the first time they tried something.And we know there are peopleinvestigating materials.And I think very soon we willhave a big surprise comingfrom the agencies.They better do because one of these daysthere is gonna be a casethat they won't be ableto control as they did in the past.Other material, other people, Iknow they exist, that some of themare alive but it is a hopemore than a certainty
